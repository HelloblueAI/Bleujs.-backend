### Model Files

- `xgboost_model_latest.pkl`: The trained XGBoost model (latest version)
- `xgboost_model.pkl`: The trained XGBoost model
- `scaler_latest.pkl`: Feature scaler for preprocessing (latest version)
- `scaler.pkl`: Feature scaler for preprocessing

## How to Use

### Installation

```bash
pip install xgboost numpy scikit-learn
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import pickle
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the model and scaler
with open('xgboost_model_latest.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

with open('scaler_latest.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    scaler = pickle.load(f)

# Prepare your data (numpy array with shape: n_samples, n_features)
X = np.array([[feature1, feature2, ...]])

# Scale the features
X_scaled = scaler.transform(X)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_scaled)
probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_scaled)

print(f"Predictions: {predictions}")
print(f"Probabilities: {probabilities}")
```

### Using with Bleu.js

```python
from bleujs import BleuJS

# Initialize BleuJS with quantum enhancements
bleu = BleuJS(
    quantum_mode=True,
    model_path="xgboost_model_latest.pkl",
    device="cuda"  # or "cpu"
)

# Process data with quantum features
results = bleu.process(
    input_data=your_data,
    quantum_features=True
)
```

### Download from Hugging Face

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
import pickle

# Download model
model_path = hf_hub_download(
    repo_id="helloblueai/bleu-xgboost-classifier",
    filename="xgboost_model_latest.pkl"
)

scaler_path = hf_hub_download(
    repo_id="helloblueai/bleu-xgboost-classifier",
    filename="scaler_latest.pkl"
)

# Load model
with open(model_path, 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

with open(scaler_path, 'rb') as f:
    scaler = pickle.load(f)
```

## Model Performance

Performance metrics will be updated after evaluation. The model uses:

- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Quantum-enhanced features for improved accuracy

## Limitations and Bias

- This model was trained on a specific dataset and may not generalize to other domains
- Performance may vary depending on input data distribution
- Quantum enhancements require compatible hardware for optimal performance
- Model performance depends on data quality and feature engineering

## Training Information

### Training Script

The model is trained using `backend/train_xgboost.py`:

```python
params = {
    "max_depth": 6,
    "learning_rate": 0.1,
    "n_estimators": 100,
    "objective": "binary:logistic",
    "random_state": 42,
}
```

### Evaluation

- Validation set: 20% of training data
- Early stopping: 10 rounds
- Evaluation metric: Log loss (default)
